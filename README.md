## SWEXSYS
=======

The Semantic Web Expert System (SWEXSYS) shell is a framework capable of building applications which reason with knowledge and data instantiated from multiple ontologies using Resource Description Framework (RDF), knowledge expressed using Rule Markup Language (RuleML), as well as other knowledge expressed as functional, structural, or causal models. 

The Semantic Web Expert System Shell has been developed in XPCE which is an object-oriented library for building Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) for symbolic or strongly typed languages and is distributed as a library on top of the hosting Prolog system.


## System Requirements

- SWI-Prolog version 5.2.10
- XPCE version  6 (bundled with SWI-Prolog)
